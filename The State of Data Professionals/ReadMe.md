# Project Title: Data Science Survey Analysis

This is the Data Science Survey Analysis project, where I conducted a comprehensive analysis of survey data using PowerBI. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and creating compelling visuals, I extracted valuable insights from the raw data. This project offers a glimpse into the fascinating world of data science and provides meaningful findings for data professionals and enthusiasts alike.

Throughout this analysis, I explored various aspects of the survey dataset. I started by conducting basic EDA within PowerBI to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data. Then, I created visuals to highlight the Total number of respondents, Average age of the participants, and the Gender distribution among the respondents. Additionally, I investigated Job roles within the data domain, examining the salaries associated with each role. I also assessed the average ratings given by data professionals for salary satisfaction and work-life balance within their job roles.

Furthermore, I examined the Distribution of respondents who transitioned to the data domain and explored their favorite programming languages within the field. All the data cleaning, analysis, and visualization tasks were performed within PowerBI, resulting in an interactive and informative dashboard that showcases the insights derived from the analysis.

This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the survey findings, empowering data professionals and enthusiasts with valuable insights. For a closer look at the visualizations please interact with the dashboard.
