# Project Title: HR Analytics Dashboard ðŸ“Š

In the HR Analytics Dashboard project, I transformed and manipulated raw data in Power BI, imported from an Excel workbook. The data, divided by months and separated into sheets in the workbook, was combined and appended into a single data table. After cleaning the data, I calculated various measures to derive insights.

## Key Measures:

Present Days: Total number of days employees were present.
Present Percent: Percentage of working days employees were present.
Sick Leave Count and Percentage: Count and percentage of sick leaves taken.
Special Sick Leave Percent: Percentage of sick leaves out of total leaves.
Work from Home Count: Count of days employees worked from home.
Work from Home Percentage: Percentage of days employees worked from home.

## Visuals Used for Highlighting the Insights:

Presence Percent of Employees (Filterable by months).
Work from Home Percentage of Employees (Filterable by months).
Present Percent Trends by Months.
Sick Leave Percent Trends by Months.
Work from Home Percent Trends by Months.
Table: Present Percent of Employees by Day of the Week.
Table: Work from Home Percent of Employees by Day of the Week.
Work from Home Percent (Filterable by month).
Table: Employee names with columns representing dates over 3 months, displaying presence status (present, work from home, leave, half day, etc.).

These visuals have been integrated into an interactive and insightful dashboard, providing a comprehensive view of HR analytics.
